               The Five Laws of Stupidity<br>

            </h1>

        <p class="forgot">In 1976, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Maria_Cipolla" title="Professor Cipolla Wiki">Professor Cipolla</a> published a 60-page essay describing the fundamental laws of a force he perceived as the greatest existential threat to humanity: <strong>stupidity.</strong><br>

            He divides humanity into four main categories: Intelligent, Bandit, Helpless, Stupid. All are defined on the basis of a win/lose concept, slightly echoing the prisoner’s dilemma. The question is: what category are you in?</p>

            <tr>
                <td>2. - The probability that a person is stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>4. - Non-stupid people always underestimate the destructive power of stupid individuals.</td>

                <h3>First Law:</h3>
                <p>No matter how many idiots you suspect you are surrounded by, you are invariably underestimating the total. This problem is compounded by the biased assumption that some people are intelligent because of superficial factors such as their job, education, or other characteristics that we believe rule out stupidity.
                  <br><br>For example, Nabilla is excluded because she is a multimillionaire. <em>And yet…</em> This brings us to the 2nd law:
                </p>
                <h3>Second Law:</h3>
                <p>Cipolla postulates that stupidity is a variable that remains constant in all populations. Every category you can imagine – gender, ethnicity, nationality, education, income – has a fixed percentage of stupid people. University professors can be stupid. There are US presidents who have been and/or are stupid. Finally, there are stupid people in every nation on Earth. How many idiots are there among us? Impossible to answer (500 according to the police, 3 million according to the trade unionists, 65 million according to Manu). Moreover, any assumption would certainly violate the first law.</p>
                <h3>Third law:</h3>
                <p>Cipolla calls it <strong>the golden law of stupidity.</strong> A stupid person, according to the economist, is a person who causes problems for others without any clear benefit for himself. Uncle couldn’t help but post fake articles on Facebook? It is stupid. The receptionist at your hotel who keeps you on the phone for an hour, hangs up on you twice and still manages to screw up your reservation? Stupid.<br><br>This law also introduces <strong>three other phenotypes</strong> that, according to Cipolla, coexist with stupidity. First, there is the <strong>intelligent person,</strong></span> whose actions benefit both himself and others. Then comes the <strong>bandit,</strong> who gets rich at the expense of others. And finally, <strong>the abused,</strong> the defenseless person, whose actions enrich others at his own expense. Cipolla imagined the four types along a graph, like this:</p>
                <img id="chart" title="Cipolla's chart on the different types of stupid people" src="/home/blender/Code/blog/images/chart.jpg" alt="Cipolla's chart on the different types of stupid people">
                <p><strong>Explanation :</strong><br><br>

                    -If Tom takes an action and suffers a loss while producing a gain for Roman, Tom’s mark will fall in the Helpless field: Tom has been abused.<br><br>
                    -If Tom makes an action by which he makes a gain while also giving a gain to Roman, Tom’s mark will fall in the I zone: Tom has acted intelligently.<br><br>
                    -Finally, if Tom takes an action by which he makes a gain causing a loss to Roman, Tom’s mark will fall in zone B: Tom has acted like a bandit.<br> Stupidity is related to the S-zone and all positions on the Y-axis below the O-point.</p>
                <h3>Fourth law:</h3>
                <p>In particular, non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times, in all places, and under all circumstances, dealing and/or associating with stupid people is always a costly mistake. We underestimate idiots, and we do so at our peril. This brings us to the fifth and final law:</p>
                <h3>Fifth Law:</h3>
                <p>And its direct consequence: <strong>a stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.</strong><br><br>

                    We can’t do anything for idiots. The difference between societies that collapse under the weight of their stupid citizens and those that transcend them is the composition of the non-stupid. Those who progress despite their stupidity have a high proportion of people who act intelligently, those who counterbalance the losses of the stupid by bringing gains for themselves and their fellows.
                    Declining societies have the same percentage of stupid people as prosperous societies. But they also have a <strong>high percentage of defenseless people and, ‘an alarming proliferation of bandits with accents of stupidity‘.</strong> Hello <em>Laurent Alexandre…<em></em>
                    
                    There is no defense against stupidity. The only way for a society to avoid being crushed by the burden of its idiots is for the non-stupid to work even harder to compensate for the losses of the stupid. When you draw the parallel with the environment, and some people trying to make up for other people’s bullshit, Cipolla was not far from the truth.</p>
